> I created this in the interest of making a cool idea available to everyone. If I complicated licensing with something as simple as a keycap, I would be defeating the core motivation behind its creation. This is how I view true success in my work: simplicity and usefulness. I wish to produce more in the future with these two goals at the forefront, and I hope this little keycap stands as a tiny little 18.1-millimeter tall monument to the open-source creation of goods and the sharing of ideas.
