This keycap design mimics the original Game Boy's cartridge design, and was directly inspired by [u/BlueBomberFox](https://www.reddit.com/user/bluebomberfox). The design closely follows that of a R1 cherry profile keycap, and should have no problems fitting on any MX-style switch. 

The included project file is for FreeCAD. As per the CC-BY license, you are welcome and encouraged to create derivative works.

This keycap was created with multiple manufacturing methods in mind. Experimentation may be necessary to get the best results. If tolerances become an issue, changes to the project file may be needed.

Should you add a front sticker to the keycap, 14mm*10.5mm is the recommended size. The sticker may need some form of lamination if the keycap is to be subject to repeated use.
